The dataset includes 1548 images.
1-2-3-4-5 are annotated in COCO format.

The following pre-processing was applied to each image:
* Auto-orientation of pixel data (with EXIF-orientation stripping)
* Resize to 640x640 (Fit within)
* Auto-contrast via contrast stretching

The following augmentation was applied to create 3 versions of each source image:
* Random exposure adjustment of between -5 and +5 percent
